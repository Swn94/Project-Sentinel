Predicting these systemic transitions is challenging because they arise from evolving interactions between market participants, not isolated price movements. We present Systemic Risk Radar (SRR), a framework that models financial markets as multi-layer graphs to detect early signs of systemic fragility and crash-regime transitions.},

It documents the historical trajectories of AI innovation for regulated banking entities and less-regulated firms, revealing that nonfinancial companies exhibit the highest baseline AI patent rate, while banks show the highest growth in AI patent rate over time. Banks have the highest HHI, and nonfinancial companies have the highest Gini coeﬀicient, suggesting that a small number of banks dominate AI innovation and the distribution of AI innovation at nonfinancial firms – though higher in number – is highly skewed toward a subset of players. These findings indicate that the AI technological gap between small and large banks may be widening and the diversity of nonfinancial companies serving as third-party AI service providers may be limited.},

	abstract = {In this era of massive biodiversity loss, birds hold the dubious distinction of being at the forefront. Currently, 21\% of avian species are vulnerable to extinction, and 6.5\% are functionally extinct. Climate change, habitat destruction, pollution, and direct killing are well-known factors contributing to declines in bird populations. In contrast, threats such as human warfare remain under-investigated, likely due to the common assumption that birds, owing to their ability to fly, can easily escape war-affected areas. Additionally, the fate of birds during most wars has been poorly documented, hindered by challenges in systematic data collection and limited human interest in avian victims of military conflict. Here, we use Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to investigate the situation of avifauna in war-affected areas of Ukraine. We present evidence that birds, including some of the most vulnerable species in the region – such as eagles, owls, avocets, flamingos, and pelicans – despite mobility, remain in areas affected by intense military activities and become their victims. Fidelity to breeding grounds and migration routes may exert a stronger influence than the adverse environmental conditions caused by war. Our study highlights warfare as a significant, yet under-recognized, contributor to avifaunal decline. While active conservation is limited during wartime, documenting bird losses and collecting field data can support future restoration and protection efforts.},

This characteristic has recently been highlighted as a key concern in the functioning of modern network-based combat systems in research on combat effect analysis. In this paper, a novel discreteevent-system-speciﬁcation-based cyber-electronic warfare M\&S (D-CEWS) was ﬁrst proposed as an integrated framework for analyzing communication effects and engagement effects on cyberelectronic warfare threats and related countermeasures that may occur within drones. Accordingly, for the ﬁrst time, based on communication metrics in tactical ad hoc networks, an analysis was conducted on the engagement effect of blue forces by major wireless threats, such as multi-layered jamming, routing attacks, and network worms. In addition, the correlations and response logics between competitive agents were also analyzed in order to recognize the efﬁciency of mutual engagements between them based on the communication system incapacitation scenarios for diverse wireless threats. As a result, the damage effect by the cyber-electronic warfare threat, which could not be considered in the existing military M\&S, could be calculated according to the PDR (packet delivery ratio) and related malicious pool rate change in the combat area, and the relevance with various threats by a quantiﬁable mission attribute given to swarming drones could also be additionally secured.},

The results demonstrated significant differences in the commanders’ preferences for unilateral or interagency forces depending on whether decisions were made in peacetime, war or the post-conflict phase. The results also showed how the commanders’ level of operational experience was associated with an increased preference for interagency forces. The current findings are new empirical insights into a thus far neglected aspect of decision-making research and have implications for improving police-military interoperability in major security crises.},

Unconsciously erasing actually existing social and political structures across the region is a condition of possibility for exclusionary strategies based on a prejudicial rationality that, ironically, risks heightening regional and US insecurity. This insight corrects a common category error claiming that the US goal in the Pacific is ‘strategic denial’ when it is more precisely described as control in the name of strategic denial. The risk that entire Pacific nations become zones for extraction or wartime sacrifice increases when policymakers imagine it as a blank canvas for a ‘great game’.},

Historically reliant on foreign technologies, China now faces challenges in developing indigenous innovation capabilities. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of financial data from Chinese listed companies with case studies, this paper assesses the impact of military-civil fusion (MCF) on innovation in China’s defence-technological industry. Findings indicate that MCF pushed stateowned enterprises (SOE) to be more efficient and to recentre on core businesses, while encouraging the gradual entry of private firms into the industry. Yet, several limitations exist. SOEs continue to enjoy greater subsidies and better integration into the national innovation system, cementing their advantage over their private counterparts. Private companies function as suppliers of large conglomerates, which remain the only ones capable of assembling advanced weapon systems. By examining the interaction between market dynamics and state-driven strategies, this paper explores the evolving role of China’s private sector in military modernization and underscores the synergies between government support and market interests in fostering innovation.},

By analyzing DPA usage, legislative actions, and public interest trends, this study aims to extract key lessons from its recent implementation. The article argues that while the DPA has become increasingly central to the government’s industrial policy initiatives, its application has been broadly inconsistent, unevenly coordinated, and insufficiently integrated into broader strategic frameworks. Reauthorization of the DPA could include creating a more permanent and coordinated executive branch infrastructure, clarifying its use as an emergency versus routine policy tool, and identifying gaps in future deployment.},

Supporters praise the effort’s targeted approach and optimistically see the case as a prime example of weaponized interdependence. But we identify three lessons from the Cold War “CoCom” technology control regime that show the problems and costs associated with the current US effort, particularly over the long haul: (1) The size of the export control regime expands over time, weakening enforcement and encouraging defection. (2) CoCom did not prevent the USSR from accessing key technologies. The current regime is similarly porous, and China is a more adept target. (3) CoCom had more favorable conditions for partner cooperation, yet was rife with tensions and jealousies that disrupted US alliances. Partner conflicts are likely to recur as controls expand and enforcement weakens. These findings have important implications for US economic security policy, US alliances, and arguments about weaponized interdependence.},

While the existing literature on the subject includes the financialization of households in the classic circuit, which increasingly supplements income from work with consumer loans and for the purchase of housing, not much space has been dedicated to other aspects of financialization. In the article, we examine the growing tendency of non-financial companies to borrow from banks for reasons that go beyond the financing of working capital and investment. In particular, they also borrow to finance mergers and acquisitions, dividends and above all, share buybacks. In addition, banks grant loans to non-bank financial institutions that buy the securities issued by companies and then resell them to the companies themselves for capital gains. Nonbank financial institutions now have access to both direct central bank funding and the ability to deposit with the central bank. The central bank will be inserted in this circuit too.},

We replace the cross-sectional distribution with low-dimensional prices as state variables and let agents learn equilibrium price dynamics directly from simulated paths. To do so, we introduce a structural reinforcement learning (SRL) method which treats prices via simulation while exploiting agents’ structural knowledge of their own individual dynamics. Our SRL method yields a general and highly efﬁcient global solution method for heterogeneous agent models that sidesteps the Master equation and handles models traditional methods struggle with, like those with nontrivial market-clearing conditions. We illustrate the approach in the Krusell-Smith model, the Huggett model with aggregate shocks, and a HANK model with a forward-looking Phillips curve, all of which we solve globally within minutes.},

Drawing on three case studies-the Russia-Ukraine War, the acquisition of S-400 missile defense system from Russia, and compliance with sanctions on Iran-, this article shows that the level of strategic autonomy pursued by states plays a pivotal role in shaping their foreign policy outcomes. India’s consistent application of strategic autonomy has contributed to its image as a predictable actor. In contrast, Turkey’s flexible approach has constrained its strategic maneuverability.},

Results show that increased trade with China correlates with higher military spending, which may suggest that countries perceive strategic risks associated with economic reliance on Beijing. In contrast, stronger trade links with the U.S. correlate with lower military expenditure, suggesting security assurances often accompanying American alliances. Geographical proximity to China leads to higher defense investments, as political stability allows countries to allocate fewer resources to their military and concentrate more on development.},

Arms companies averaged 10 percentage points of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) after the Russian invasion, but after the Hamas attack, CAR was indistinguishable from zero. Given that the Hamas attack was a surprise to nearly everyone, but the Russian attack was the accumulation of a building tension, the results are even more paradoxical, as the anticipated attack had substantial impacts on financial markets while the surprise attack had no apparent impact.
