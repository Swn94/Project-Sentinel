	abstract = {This study analyzes the December 3, 2024 martial law incident declared by President Yoon Suk-yeol through the analytical lens of Peter Senge's System Archetypes theory. Eight archetypes are applied to this case: escalation, success to the successful, shifting the burden to the intervenor, balancing process with delay, fixes that fail, shifting the burden, erosion of goals, and limits to growth. Additionally, the president's confirmation bias is examined using causal loop diagrams to highlight its systemic impact.},
